# Hi, there

This is my **FIRST** PERN (Postgre, Express, React, Node) e-commerce app. It is a part of my coding course. It is developed all by my own and learned so many.

## What it can do

Basically, it can materialize the basic workflow when you shop online. Registration, login, google authentication, browsing products, modifying cart items, payment, viewing order history etc, just like the normal e-commerce site. Of course, it is now a primitive version.

## Continue on with it shortly

For the moment, I have to move on and finish the rest of my course. **BUT** I will come back to it very shortly to polish it to the next level to make it one of my portfolio projects. By the time, it will be a e-commerce app in a specific industry. Oh, yes, I have something in mind!

## Peace out

Take care! See you in next project! Again, happy learning coding! :zany_face:
